If you want to submit your data to the platform, you need to register an account. Then you can access the [submit page](https://www.chinese-quartet.org/#/data/upload) to submit your data and metadata table. You can follow the [tutorial](https://docs.chinese-quartet.org/getting_started/submit_data/) to submit your data.

The following is the data submission policy:

### Purpose

### Submission Guidelines

- The Quartet team reserves the right to review all data submissions for quality and compliance, and to reject submissions that fail to meet the established criteria or violate this policy.

- This policy may be revised periodically based on changes in legal, ethical, or technological contexts. All changes will be communicated to the relevant parties.

- Failure to comply with this policy may result in rejection of data, termination of data access, and potential legal action.

Multi-omics (or molecular phenomics) profiling at the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic levels is the cornerstone of high-throughput technologies for discovering biomarkers for precision medicine. However, the lack of quality control procedures of multi-omics profiling during data generation and data analysis can lead to false findings, raising serious concerns about the reliability of multi-omics studies.

The Quartet Project provides publicly accessible multi-omics reference materials and practical tools to enhance the reproducibility and reliability of multi-omics results. Well-characterized multiomics reference materials and quality control metrics pertinent to precision medicine study purposes can be used to measure and mitigate technical variation, enabling more accurate cross-batch and cross-omics data integration in increasingly large-scale and longitudinal studies such as the International Human Phenome Project.
